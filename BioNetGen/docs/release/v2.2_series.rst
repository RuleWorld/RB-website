2.2.0 (Dec 6, 2017)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Important Changes**:


  * Single word keywords *not* followed by "and" logical operator are not
    accepted, e.g. "protein within 5 of water" will raise a
    :class:`.SelectionError`, use "protein and within 5 of water" instead.

  * :func:`findMatchingChains` is renamed to  :func:`.matchChains`.

  * :func:`showOverlapMatrix` is renamed to :func:`.showOverlapTable`.

  * Modules are reorganized.

**New Features**:

  * :class:`.Atomic` for easy type checking.

  * :class:`.Contacts` for faster intermolecular contact identification.

  * :class:`.Select` can identify intermolecular contacts. See :ref:`contacts`
    for an examples and details.

  * :func:`.sampleModes` implemented for sampling conformations along normal
    modes.

**Improvements**:

  * :mod:`.proteins.compare` functions are improved. Now they perform sequence
    alignment if simple residue number/identity based matchin does not work,
    or if user passes ``pwalign=True`` argument. This impacts the speed
    of X-ray ensemble analysis.

  * :class:`.Select` can cache data optionally. This results in speeds up from
    2 to 50 folds depending on number of atoms and selection operations.

  * Implementation of :func:`.showProjection` is completed.
