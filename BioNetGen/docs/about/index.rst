About BioNetGen
===============

BioNetGen is software for the specification and simulation of rule-based models of biochemical systems, including signal transduction, metabolic, and genetic regulatory networks. A comprehensive introduction to modeling with BioNetGen is available and is augmented by the models found in the BioNetGen distribution and in the Model Examples. The BioNetGen language has recently been extended to include explicit representation of compartments. A recent review of methods for rule-based modeling is available in Science Signaling (formerly known as Science's STKE).
